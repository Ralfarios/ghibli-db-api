Welcome to GhibliDB API 🎉!
Do you want to make a dummy web/mobile app with Studio Ghibli's films in there but too lazy to make mock server? Do you love Studio Ghibli's and want to see their movie list? You came to the right place!

With this Rest API, you can see Ghibli's Movie List, detailed Ghibli's movie information, poster image, director and writer, etc. Just use it for free without API Key 🗝️ and that's it!
